# DIS_projekt

This is our DIS_Project :)
We wanted to make a overview of all candidates from the last folketingsvalg in Denmark in 2022.
Due to technical issues, we instead made an applicaton in the correct theme, where a person can see a few candidates, add/delete/update their own, or search the database for existing candidates. The application thus lives up to the requirements set fourth by the assignment. 


## How to run:

Before running the application, a user needs to do several things:
1. Create a database in postgres. This can fx. be done using the terminal, using;
psql -U postgres
[insert passwors]
$CREATE DATABASE

## How to navigate:
- Use the mouse
