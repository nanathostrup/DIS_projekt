# DIS_projekt

This is our DIS_Project :)
We wanted to make a overview of all candidates from the last folketingsvalg in Denmark in 2022.
Due to technical issues, we instead made an applicaton in the correct theme, where a person can see a few candidates, add/delete/update their own, or search the database for existing candidates. The application thus lives up to the requirements set fourth by the assignment. 


## How to run:

Before running the application, a user needs to do several things:

### clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/nanathostrup/DIS_projekt
